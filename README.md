The Legend of: Virtual Magic Kingdom
============================

The Legend of: Virtual Magic Kingdom is a private server (will be public) for Disney's closed MMO, Pirates of the Caribbean Online. This is the game development repository.

Collaboration Policy
====================

As long as your changes aren't hurting development, don't be afraid to commit your changes. Create a new branch if necessary. This creates for better collaboration between team mates and to speed up production by allowing multiple people to participate.

Contributing Assistance
=======================

You have to "git clone" or pull whenever you don't have the latest code base on the repository. For coding, do not use tabs, use 4 spaces instead because tabbing just ruins the code.

Also remember the #1 rule of Git: Never force a Git push! Ever!

Issues & Discussion
===================

To discuss an issue with the game or something that we need to do, go to the issues area of the repository and you can find issues that we need to get done.
